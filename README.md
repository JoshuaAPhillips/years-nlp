# Processing *The Years* (1937) with NLTK

This is a holding page for some very preliminary experiments trying to distantly read Virginia Woolf's 1937 novel *The Years* using Python's `Natural Language Toolkit` package. The idea is to quantify how (or indeed if) the novel's prose style changes over its 60-year time scale.
