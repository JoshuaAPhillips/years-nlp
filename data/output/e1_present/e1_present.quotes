5864	5874	5875	5875	he	47	" But there was one letter you wrote me , "
5881	5890	5875	5875	he	47	" An angry letter ; a cruel letter . "
5917	5920	5921	5921	she	283	" Yes ? "
5924	5934	5935	5935	he	47	" The night you came in from the Strand , "
5966	5970	5972	5972	Sara	58	" I remember , "
5982	6004	5972	5972	Sara	58	" a still autumn night ; the lights lit ; and people padding along the pavement with wreaths in their hands ? "
6005	6008	6009	6009	he	47	" Yes , "
6012	6017	6009	6009	he	47	" That was it . "

6148	6151	6152	6152	he	47	" Poppycock ! "

6232	6238	6239	6239	she	58	" Stood and looked down , "
6254	6274	6239	6239	she	58	" and thought ; Running water , flowing water , water that crinkles up the lights ; moonlight ; starlight-- "
6281	6287	6288	6288	he	47	" Then the car came , "
6292	6309	6239	6239	she	58	" Yes ; the Rolls - Royce . It stopped in the lamplight and there they sat-- "
6310	6314	6315	6315	he	47	" Two people , "
6319	6325	6326	6326	she	58	" Two people . Yes , "
6329	6375	6377	6377	her	58	" He was smoking a cigar . An upper- class Englishman with a big nose , in a dress suit . And she , sitting beside him , in a fur - trimmed cloak , took advantage of the pause under the lamplight to raise her hand"--she
6379	6388	6377	6377	her	58	" and polish that spade , her mouth . "
6394	6399	6400	6400	he	47	" And the peroration ? "

7535	7562	7533	7533	Eleanor	46	" But I can just remember it , when I was a child . That reminds me , if you want a good man to clean pictures-- "
7563	7570	7571	7571	Peggy	52	" But was it like her ? "
7620	7628	7629	7629	Eleanor	46	" I 've got the address somewhere , "
7633	7641	7643	7643	Peggy	52	" Do n't bother -- don't bother , "
7681	7687	7688	7688	she	52	" Was it like her ? "
7692	7699	7701	7701	Eleanor	46	" Not as I remember her , "
7710	7734	7735	7735	she	46	" When I was a child perhaps -- no , I do n't think even as a child . What 's so interesting , "
7738	7762	7763	7763	she	46	" is that what they thought ugly -- red hair for instance -- we think pretty ; so that I often ask myself , "
7771	7778	7763	7763	she	46	" ' What is pretty ? ' "
7779	7782	7784	7784	Peggy	52	" Yes , "
7786	7794	7784	7784	Peggy	52	" That 's what we were saying . "
7859	7868	7869	7869	she	52	" Is there any standard , d'you think ? "
7883	7887	7892	7892	She	46	" I wonder , "
7899	7903	7904	7904	she	46	" How annoying ! "
7908	7965	7904	7904	she	46	" I had it on the tip of my tongue -- something I want to ask you . Then I thought of Delia 's party : then North made me laugh -- Sally sitting on the edge of her chair with a smudge on her nose ; and that 's put it out of my head . "
7971	7998	7999	7999	she	46	" D'you know the feeling when one 's been on the point of saying something , and been interrupted ; how it seems to stick HERE , "
8004	8020	8021	8021	she	46	" so that it stops everything else ? Not that it was anything of importance , "
8033	8046	8047	8047	she	46	" No , I give it up ; I give it up , "
8054	8070	8118	8118	She	52	" I shall go and get ready now , if you 'll call a cab . "
8137	8142	8118	8118	She	52	them--"Mon Repos , Wimbledon . "
8174	8196	8169	8169	Eleanor	46	" He says every tooth is quite unlike every other tooth . And he knows all about plants . . . . "
8274	8279	8281	8281	she	52	" Number , please , "
8444	8447	8461	8461	she	52	" Hullo , "
8493	8514	8515	8515	Peggy	52	" One of these days d'you think you 'll be able to see things at the end of the telephone ? "
8574	8579	8581	8581	Eleanor	46	" What 's that ? "
8773	8788	8789	8789	she	46	" That 's where I saw my first aeroplane -- there between those chimneys , "
8819	8828	8829	8829	Eleanor	46	" I was standing here , looking out , "
8833	8902	8829	8829	Eleanor	46	" It must have been just after I 'd got into the flat , a summer 's day , and I saw a black spot in the sky , and I said to whoever it was -- Miriam Parrish , I think , yes , for she came to help me to get into the flat -- I hope Delia , by the way , remembered to ask her-- "
8921	8926	8927	8927	she	52	" You said to Miriam-- "
8931	9036	8911	8911	Peggy	52	" I said to Miriam , ' Is it a bird ? No , I do n't think it can be a bird . It 's too big . Yet it moves . ' And suddenly it came over me , that 's an aeroplane ! And it was ! You know they 'd flown the Channel not so very long before . I was staying with you in Dorset at the time : and I remember reading it out in the paper , and someone -- your father , I think -- said : ' The world will never be the same again ! "
9037	9041	9042	9042	Peggy	52	" Oh , well-- "
9097	9101	9102	9102	she	46	" Oh dear , "
9177	9182	9183	9183	Peggy	52	" What , Nell-- ? "
9186	9191	9193	9193	Eleanor	46	" Nothing , nothing , "
9307	9318	9324	9324	his	53	" We are children playing with fireworks in the back garden "
9346	9354	9355	9355	Sally	58	" A new world-- a new world ! "
9388	9391	9392	9392	she	52	" Yes , "
9404	9495	9496	9496	She	52	" Yes -- I do n't know about aeroplanes , I 've never been up in one ; but motor cars -- I could do without motor cars . I was almost knocked down by one , did I tell you ? In the Brompton Road . All my own fault -- I was n't looking . . . . And wireless -- that 's a nuisance-- the people downstairs turn it on after breakfast ; but on the other hand -- hot water ; electric light ; and those new-- "
9499	9506	9507	9507	she	52	" Ah , there it is ! "
9522	9544	9510	9510	She	52	" If Edward 's there tonight , do remind me -- I'll tie a knot in my handkerchief . . . . "
9568	9577	9545	9545	She	52	" to ask him about Runcorn 's boy . "
9582	9586	9587	9587	she	52	" The taxi , "
9637	9642	9643	9643	she	52	" What a face ! "
9682	9684	9685	9685	Eleanor	46	" Damned-- "
9690	9693	9694	9694	She	46	" bully ! "
9730	9732	9694	9694	She	46	" damned "
9766	9768	9757	9757	Eleanor	46	" damned "
9771	9774	9757	9757	Eleanor	46	" bully , "
9934	9939	9940	9940	she	52	" Take my aunt , "
9964	9989	9990	9990	Eleanor	46	" take my aunt , living alone in a sort of workman 's flat at the top of six flights of stairs . . . "
9993	9999	10000	10000	she	52	" Do n't tell me , "
10003	10024	10000	10000	she	52	" that I left the letter upstairs-- Runcorn 's letter that I want to show Edward , about the boy ? "
10030	10037	10025	10025	She	52	" No : here it is . "
10137	10141	10142	10142	Eleanor	46	" You see , "
10154	10165	10147	10147	she	46	" it means the end of everything we cared for . "
10166	10169	10171	10171	Peggy	52	" Freedom ? "
10174	10177	10179	10179	Eleanor	46	" Yes , "
10181	10186	10179	10179	Eleanor	46	" Freedom and justice . "
10248	10255	10256	10256	she	52	" Suddenly she lost her temper , "
10259	10276	10256	10256	she	52	" took the paper and tore it across -- my aunt , who 's over seventy . "
10291	10300	10301	10301	she	52	" That 's where we used to live , "
10367	10371	10373	10373	Eleanor	46	" Abercorn Terrace , "
10375	10384	10385	10385	she	46	" . . . the pillar - box , "
10435	10439	10440	10440	Eleanor	46	" Are n't people-- "
10458	10461	10463	10463	Peggy	52	" Yes ? "
10472	10487	10488	10488	Eleanor	46	" I was going to say -- the pillar - box made me think , "
10548	10557	10558	10558	she	52	" That 's where we used to dine , "
10574	10642	10643	10643	she	430	" Your father and I. The man he used to read with . What was his name ? He became a Judge . . . . We used to dine there , the three of us . Morris , my father and I. . . . They had very large parties in those days . Always legal people . And he collected old oak . Mostly shams , "
10650	10658	10659	10659	Peggy	52	" You used to dine . . . "
10700	10709	10710	10710	she	430	" Tell me about your youth . . . "
10713	10725	10727	10727	Eleanor	46	" But your lives are much more interesting than ours were , "
10903	10919	10920	10920	she	46	" And the experiment with the guinea - pig -- how did that go off ? "
10934	10969	10928	10928	she	52	" I see . So it proved nothing . So you 've got to begin all over again . That 's very interesting . Now I wish you 'd explain to me . . . "
11023	11028	11018	11018	you	448	" What 's eight times eight?"--she
11055	11065	11066	11066	she	46	" It 's so good of you to come , "
11094	11103	11104	11104	Eleanor	46	" It 's a way of seeing people , "
11107	11130	11104	11104	Eleanor	46	" And now that we 're all getting on -- not you , us -- one does n't like to miss chances . "
11155	11157	11143	11143	Peggy	52	" Sentimental "
11365	11374	11376	11376	Eleanor	46	" You 're too young to feel that , "
11378	11381	11382	11382	Peggy	52	" What ? "
11389	11402	11429	11429	her	52	" About meeting people . About not missing chances of seeing them . "
11403	11406	11408	11408	Peggy	52	" Young ? "
11410	11421	11422	11422	She	52	" I shall never be as young as you are ! "
11432	11440	11441	11441	she	52	" Gallivanting off to India . . . "
11444	11454	11456	11456	Eleanor	46	" Oh , India . India 's nothing nowadays , "
11458	11489	11490	11490	she	46	" Travel 's so easy . You just take a ticket ; just get on board ship . . . . But what I want to see before I die , "
11493	11501	11490	11490	she	46	" is something different . . . . "
11522	11552	11504	11504	her	46	" . . . another kind of civilisation . Tibet , for instance . I was reading a book by a man called -- now what was he called ? "
11564	11573	11574	11574	she	46	" Do n't people wear pretty clothes nowadays ? "
11592	11595	11597	11597	Peggy	52	" Yes , "
11631	11643	11644	11644	she	52	" Was it that you were suppressed when you were young ? "
11679	11682	11683	11683	she	46	" Suppressed ? "
11698	11707	11708	11708	she	46	" Oh , I see what you mean , "
11804	11811	11812	11812	she	46	" Where 's he taking us ? "
11935	11946	11948	11948	Peggy	52	" Always reminds me of an advertisement of sanitary towels , "
12035	12047	12048	12048	she	46	" The only fine thing that was said in the war , "
12060	12068	12070	12070	Peggy	52	" It did n't come to much , "
12101	12110	12112	12112	Eleanor	46	" Do n't people wear pretty clothes nowadays ? "
12134	12137	12139	12139	Peggy	52	" Yes , "
12203	12213	12214	12214	Eleanor	46	" It 's nice , having North back again , "
12217	12220	12222	12222	Peggy	52	" Yes , "
12224	12236	12237	12237	she	52	" He says we talk of nothing but money and politics , "
12263	12267	12268	12268	she	46	" Does he ? "
12271	12277	12268	12268	she	46	" But then . . . "
12333	12342	12343	12343	she	46	" He 'll find his way in time , "
12403	12414	12415	12415	she	46	" He 'll have to turn , that 's all , "
12418	12424	12425	12425	she	46	" I 'm not despondent , "
12433	12472	12425	12425	she	46	" Travelling , you see : when one has to mix up with all sorts of other people on board ship , or in one of those little places where one has to stay -- off the beaten track-- "
12481	12489	12490	12490	she	46	house--"You ought to go there , Peggy , "
12494	12524	12525	12525	She	46	" you ought to travel : the natives are so beautiful you know ; half naked : going down to the river in the moonlight;--that 's the house over there-- "
12536	12577	12525	12525	She	46	" What was I saying ? I 'm not despondent , no , because people are so kind , so good at heart . . . . So that if only ordinary people , ordinary people like ourselves . . . "
12613	12622	12623	12623	she	46	" No , no , no , Peggy , "
12626	12637	12638	12638	Peggy	52	" It 's my cab . It 's my cab , "
12641	12650	12652	12652	Eleanor	46	" But I insist on paying my share , "
12658	12663	12665	12665	North	47	" That 's Eleanor , "
12686	12700	12701	12701	he	47	" She told me to tell you to come to Delia 's party , "
12704	12716	12717	12717	she	58	" To Delia 's party ? Why to Delia 's party ? "
12720	12731	12732	12732	he	47	" Because they 're old and want you to come , "
12739	12754	12755	12755	she	58	" Old Eleanor ; wandering Eleanor ; Eleanor with the wild eyes . . . "
12758	12773	12774	12774	she	58	" Shall I , sha n't I , shall I , sha n't I ? "
12782	12785	12786	12786	she	58	" No , "
12796	12801	12786	12786	she	58	" I sha n't . "
12802	12806	12807	12807	he	47	" You must , "
12825	12832	12833	12833	she	58	" I must , must I ? "
12840	12843	12844	12844	she	58	" Then , "
12861	12868	12844	12844	she	58	" read until we must go . "
12956	12967	12968	12968	he	47	" I ca n't see to read without a light , "
12997	13005	13006	13006	she	58	" Shall I turn on the light ? "
13009	13012	13013	13013	he	47	" No , "
13016	13024	13013	13013	he	47	" I 'll try to remember something . "
13076	13080	13081	13081	she	58	" Go on , "
13199	13203	13204	13204	she	58	" The Jew , "
13207	13211	13212	13212	he	47	" The Jew ? "
13241	13248	13249	13249	she	58	" The Jew having a bath , "
13252	13259	13260	13260	he	47	" The Jew having a bath ? "
13263	13277	13278	13278	she	58	" And tomorrow there 'll be a line of grease round the bath , "
13281	13286	13287	13287	he	47	" Damn the Jew ! "
13311	13314	13316	13316	Sara	58	" Go on-- "
13318	13325	13326	13326	she	58	" Society is all but rude , "
13332	13338	13326	13326	she	58	" to this delicious solitude . "
13339	13342	13343	13343	he	47	" No , "
13365	13371	13372	13372	he	47	" Who is this Jew ? "
13375	13383	13384	13384	she	58	" Abrahamson , in the tallow trade , "
13390	13402	13403	13403	she	58	" Engaged to a pretty girl in a tailor 's shop , "
13426	13435	13436	13436	she	58	" But he leaves hairs in the bath , "
13465	13473	13474	13474	he	47	" D'you share a bath with him ? "
13485	13488	13480	13480	He	47	" Pah ! "
13489	13500	13501	13501	she	58	" ' Pah . ' That 's what I said , "
13504	13521	13501	13501	she	58	" ' Pah!'--when I went into the bathroom on a cold winter 's morning--'Pah!'--she threw her hand out--"'Pah
13524	13527	13501	13501	she	58	" She paused .
13528	13532	13533	13533	he	47	" And then-- ? "
13536	13540	13541	13541	she	58	" And then , "
13548	13594	13595	13595	she	58	" I came back into the sitting - room . And breakfast was waiting . Fried eggs and a bit of toast . Lydia with her blouse torn and her hair down . The unemployed singing hymns under the window . And I said to myself-- "
13601	13632	13633	13633	she	58	" ' Polluted city , unbelieving city , city of dead fish and worn - out frying - pans'--thinking of a river 's bank , when the tide 's out , "
13636	13640	13641	13641	he	47	" Go on , "
13644	13660	13661	13661	she	58	" So I put on my hat and coat and rushed out in a rage , "
13664	13700	13661	13661	she	58	" and stood on the bridge , and said , ' Am I a weed , carried this way , that way , on a tide that comes twice a day without a meaning ? ' "
13701	13704	13705	13705	he	47	" Yes ? "
13709	13758	13765	13765	she	58	" And there were people passing ; the strutting ; the tiptoeing ; the pasty ; the ferret - eyed ; the bowler - hatted , servile innumerable army of workers . And I said , ' Must I join your conspiracy ? Stain the hand , the unstained hand,'"--he
13779	13806	13765	13765	she	58	" ' --and sign on , and serve a master ; all because of a Jew in my bath , all because of a Jew ? ' "
13832	13839	13840	13840	he	47	" Go on , go on , "
13843	13856	13807	13807	She	58	" But I had a talisman , a glowing gem , a lucent emerald"--she
13865	13927	13928	13928	She	58	floor--"a letter of introduction . And I said to the flunkey in peach - blossom trousers , ' Admit me , sirrah , ' and he led me along corridors piled with purple till I came to a door , a mahogany door , and knocked ; and a voice said , ' Enter . ' And what did I find ? "
13931	13975	13928	13928	She	58	" A stout man with red cheeks . On his table three orchids in a vase . Pressed into your hand , I thought , as the car crunches the gravel by your wife at parting . And over the fireplace the usual picture-- "
13976	13979	13980	13980	North	47	" Stop ! "
13984	13992	13993	13993	he	47	" You have come to an office , "
13998	14010	13993	13993	he	47	" You are presenting a letter of introduction-- but to whom ? "
14011	14017	14018	14018	she	58	" Oh , to whom ? "
14021	14087	14018	14018	she	58	" To a man in sponge - bag trousers . ' I knew your father at Oxford , ' he said , toying with the blotting- paper , ornamented in one corner with a cartwheel . But what do YOU find insoluble , I asked him , looking at the mahogany man , the clean - shaven , rosy - gilled , mutton - fed man-- "
14088	14096	14097	14097	North	47	" The man in a newspaper office , "
14101	14110	14097	14097	North	47	" who knew your father . And then ? "
14111	14182	14183	14183	She	58	" There was a humming and a grinding . The great machines went round ; and little boys popped in with elongated sheets ; black sheets ; smudged ; damp with printer 's ink . ' Pardon me a moment , ' he said , and made a note in the margin . But the Jew 's in my bath , I said -- the Jew . . . the Jew-- "

37128	37135	37136	37136	he	118	" And it 's my belief , "
37147	37183	37136	37136	he	118	" that we should all be very glad , very glad , to go back to things as they were . What 's the War done for us , eh ? Ruined me for one . "
37196	37204	37206	37206	Kitty	92	" I 'm sorry to hear that , "
37208	37230	37206	37206	Kitty	92	" But speaking for myself , the old days were bad days , wicked days , cruel days . . . . "

37415	37426	37427	37427	he	118	" And it 's just the same with the Irish , "

37619	37632	37633	37633	he	118	" . . . But what strikes an old fellow like me , "

44355	44359	44360	44360	he	53	" But Delia , "
44367	44386	44387	44387	he	53	" it 's not what YOU want ; it 's what WE want . And it is fitting , "
44395	44406	44387	44387	he	53	" when our hearts are full of gratitude . . . "
44432	44444	44445	44445	he	53	" . . . when our hearts are full of gratitude , "

44798	44804	44805	44805	she	92	" But Rose was wrong , "
44808	44822	44805	44805	she	92	" Force is always wrong,-- do n't you agree with me , Edward ? "
44842	44845	44846	44846	she	92	" Still , "
44850	44870	44846	44846	she	92	" Rose had the courage of her convictions . Rose went to prison . And I drink to her ! "
44874	44882	44884	44884	Rose	93	" The same to you , Kitty , "
44890	44896	44897	44897	Martin	88	" She smashed his window , "
44902	44922	44897	44897	Martin	88	" and then she helped him to smash other people 's windows . Where 's your decoration , Rose ? "
44923	44932	44934	44934	Rose	93	" In a cardboard box on the mantelpiece , "
44936	44956	44934	44934	Rose	93	" You ca n't get a rise out of me at this time of day , my good fellow . "
44957	44969	44971	44971	Eleanor	46	" But I wish you had let Nicholas finish his speech , "
45028	45032	45034	45034	Eleanor	46	" Another dance ? "
45041	45047	45048	45048	she	46	" When we were young , "
45055	45064	45048	45048	she	46	" we used to dance . . . . "
45094	45101	45103	45103	Kitty	92	" And how I hated it ! "
45116	45122	45123	45123	she	92	" How nice it is , "
45126	45149	45150	45150	she	92	" not to be young ! How nice not to mind what people think ! Now one can live as one likes , "
45153	45163	45150	45150	she	92	" . . . now that one 's seventy . "
45177	45185	45186	45186	she	92	" Pity one ca n't live again , "

45240	45246	45247	45247	he	53	" What 's the good ? "
45250	45256	45247	45247	he	53	" Nobody wants to listen . "
45297	45304	45306	45306	Kitty	92	" But I want a speech ! "
45354	45359	45361	45361	Eleanor	46	" There 's Peggy ! "

45399	45408	45410	45411	Lady Lasswade	119	" Speak for the younger generation , Peggy ! "
45416	45425	45427	45427	Peggy	52	" But I 'm not the younger generation , "
45429	45438	45439	45439	she	52	" And I 've made my speech already , "
45442	45451	45452	45452	she	52	" I made a fool of myself upstairs , "
45465	45472	45474	45474	Eleanor	46	" Then , North . . . "

45512	45524	45525	45525	she	52	" North says we talk of nothing but money and politics , "
45528	45537	45538	45538	He	47	" Tell us what we ought to do . "
45698	45709	45710	45710	Kitty	92	" . . . It 's a nice little house , "
45714	45746	45710	45710	Kitty	92	" An old mad woman used to live there . . . . You 'll have to come and stay with me , Nell . In the spring . . . . "
45759	45766	45767	45767	he	47	" What you said was true , "
45771	45778	45767	45767	he	47	" . . . quite true . "
45838	45855	45864	45864	her	119	" What was the name of the man I used to like so much at Oxford ? "
45871	45879	45880	45880	Edward	72	" The man you liked at Oxford ? "
45884	45897	45880	45880	Edward	72	" I thought you never liked anyone at Oxford . . . . "
45966	45978	45979	45979	he	47	" . . . To live differently . . . differently , "
46041	46048	46049	46050	Lady Lasswade	119	" Yes , it was Robson ! "
46062	46068	46069	46069	she	119	" How one forgets things ! "
46073	46104	46069	46069	she	119	" Of course -- Robson . That was his name . And the girl I used to like -- Nelly ? The girl who was going to be a doctor ? "
46105	46111	46113	46113	Edward	72	" Died , I think , "
46115	46122	46124	46125	Lady Lasswade	119	" Died , did she -- died-- "
46133	46144	46145	46145	she	119	" Well , I wish you 'd make your speech , "
46555	46568	46574	46574	Kitty	92	" Wake up , North . . . we want your speech ! "
46584	46587	46588	46588	he	72	" Maggie ! "

46630	46635	46638	46638	her	92	" Speak , speak ! "
46807	46833	46834	46834	she	92	" And what was your speech going to have been about , Mr . . . I 'm afraid I do n't know your name ? "
46837	46847	46944	46944	He	53	" . . . the one that was interrupted ? "
46848	46852	46853	46853	he	53	" My speech ? "
46856	46865	46866	46866	he	53	" It was to have been a miracle ! "
46869	46942	46944	46944	He	53	" A masterpiece ! But how can one speak when one is always interrupted ? I begin : I say , Let us give thanks . Then Delia says , Do n't thank me . I begin again : I say , Let us give thanks to someone , to somebody . . . And Renny says , What for ? I begin again , and look -- Eleanor is sound asleep . "
46950	46957	46944	46944	He	53	" So what 's the good ? "
46958	46966	46967	46967	Kitty	92	" Oh , but there is some good-- "
46997	47013	47014	47014	she	92	" Tell me , privately , what you were going to have said , Mr-- ? "
47018	47033	47034	47034	he	53	" What I was going to have said ? I was going to have said-- "
47048	47070	47071	47071	he	53	" First I was going to have thanked our host and hostess . Then I was going to have thanked this house-- "
47087	47106	47107	47107	he	53	" --which has sheltered the lovers , the creators , the men and women of goodwill . And finally-- "
47115	47130	47131	47131	he	53	" I was going to drink to the human race . The human race , "
47141	47159	47160	47160	he	53	" which is now in its infancy , may it grow to maturity ! Ladies and gentlemen ! "
47170	47176	47160	47160	he	53	" I drink to that ! "
47192	47201	47203	47203	Delia	68	" That 's the thirteenth glass broken tonight ! "
