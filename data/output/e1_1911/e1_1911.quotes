3317	3326	3328	3328	Morris	32	" No . Athens is not an Embassy , "
3358	3371	3372	3373	Sir William	29	" There 's going to be trouble there in the near future , "
3454	3465	3466	3466	he	29	" Your sister has the brightest eyes I ever saw , "

4093	4099	4091	4091	Peggy	27	" he 's so regular . "
4106	4116	4117	4117	she	33	" Shall we leave the gentlemen to their politics , "
4120	4129	4117	4117	she	33	" and have our coffee on the terrace ? "
4142	4149	4151	4151	Eleanor	31	" I 'll fetch my glasses , "
4361	4373	4374	4374	Peggy	27	" Did father say Sir William was in love with her ? "
4383	4392	4394	4394	Celia	33	" Oh I do n't know about that , "
4396	4422	4423	4423	she	33	" But I wish they could have married . I wish she had children of her own . And then they could have settled here , "
4426	4434	4423	4423	she	33	" He 's such a delightful man . "
4447	4467	4444	4444	Celia	33	" I hope you were polite to the Robinsons this afternoon , dreadful as they are . . . . "

4576	4584	4569	4569	Peggy	27	" He 'll come along that hedge . "
4606	4609	4611	4611	Celia	33	" Now , "
4618	4630	4611	4611	Celia	33	" There are so many things I want to ask you . "
4665	4671	4672	4672	she	33	" In the first place , "
4675	4681	4672	4672	she	33	" No . . . . "
4691	4699	4700	4700	she	33	" What 's all this about Rose ? "
4703	4706	4708	4708	Eleanor	31	" What ? "
4718	4725	4726	4726	she	33	" It 's getting too dark , "
4734	4748	4750	4750	Celia	33	" Morris says she 's been had up in a police - court , "
4762	4767	4769	4769	Eleanor	31	" She threw a brick-- "
4794	4802	4803	4803	Peggy	27	" Will she be put in prison ? "
4807	4812	4814	4814	Eleanor	31	" Not this time , "
4816	4826	4827	4827	she	31	" Next time -- Ah , here he comes ! "
4871	4881	4882	4882	she	31	" He 's got a mouse in his claws ! "
4885	4895	4897	4897	Peggy	27	" He 's got a nest in the steeple , "
4909	4919	4921	4921	Eleanor	31	" Now I ca n't see him any more , "
4951	4958	4959	4959	she	33	" Tell me about William Whatney , "
4962	4978	4959	4959	she	33	" When I last saw him he was a slim young man in a boat . "
4984	4992	4993	4993	she	27	" That must have been ages ago ! "
4996	5002	5004	5004	Eleanor	31	" Not so very long , "
5011	5013	5014	5014	she	31	" Well-- "
5017	5027	5014	5014	she	31	" twenty years -- twenty - five years perhaps . "
5058	5066	5067	5067	Celia	33	" Is n't he a delightful man ? "
5070	5105	5067	5067	Celia	33	" He was in India , you know . Now he 's retired , and we do hope he 'll take a house here ; but Morris thinks he 'd find it too dull . "
5150	5161	5163	5163	Peggy	27	" It 's going to be another hot day tomorrow , "
5286	5292	5293	5293	she	27	" How lovely it is ! "
5307	5316	5318	5318	Celia	33	" If only Mr Robinson does n't build ! "
5337	5352	5353	5353	Celia	33	" I did my best to be polite to them at the bazaar today , "
5356	5380	5353	5353	Celia	33	" Some people wo n't ask them ; but I say one must be polite to neighbours in the country . . . . "
5385	5397	5398	5398	she	33	" There are so many things I want to ask you , "
5414	5425	5426	5426	Celia	33	" Have you had an offer for Abercorn Terrace yet ? "
5440	5444	5446	5446	Eleanor	31	" Not yet , "
5448	5460	5446	5446	Eleanor	31	" The agent wants me to cut it up into flats . "
5470	5485	5465	5465	she	33	" And now about Maggie -- when 's her baby going to be born ? "
5486	5493	5495	5495	Eleanor	31	" In November , I think , "
5497	5501	5502	5502	she	31	" In Paris , "
5505	5514	5516	5516	Celia	33	" I hope it 'll be all right , "
5518	5531	5532	5532	She	33	" But I do wish it could have been born in England . "
5536	5546	5547	5547	she	33	" Her children will be French , I suppose ? "
5550	5558	5560	5560	Eleanor	31	" Yes ; French , I suppose , "
5584	5594	5596	5596	Celia	33	" Everybody says he 's a very nice fellow , "
5598	5606	5596	5596	Celia	33	" But Ren � -- Ren � , "
5612	5623	5596	5596	Celia	33	" --it does n't sound like a man 's name . "
5624	5631	5633	5633	Peggy	27	" You can call him Renny , "
5642	5666	5596	5596	Celia	33	" But that reminds me of Ronny ; and I do n't like Ronny . We had a stable - boy called Ronny . "
5667	5673	5675	5675	Peggy	27	" Who stole the hay , "
5682	5688	5689	5689	Celia	33	" It 's such a pity-- "
5706	5717	5719	5719	Celia	33	" It 's a wonderful night , is n't it ? "
5730	5752	5719	5719	Celia	33	" It looks as if it would never rain again . In which case I do n't know . . . . "
5784	5797	5800	5800	Celia	33	" Oh , but there 's quite enough for everybody at present , "
5821	5829	5830	5830	she	31	" --quite enough for everybody at present , "
5901	5907	5908	5908	Celia	33	" What was I saying ? "
5911	5927	5908	5908	Celia	33	" I was saying , It 's such a pity . Yes . . . . "
5948	5955	5956	5956	she	31	" Oh , here they are ! "
6055	6060	6062	6062	North	42	" There he goes , "
6126	6137	6139	6139	Morris	32	" It 's going to be a fine day tomorrow , "
6226	6231	6232	6232	Celia	33	" I hate bats ! "

6252	6258	6259	6259	His	29	" I rather like them . "
6282	6290	6291	6291	Celia	33	" They get into one 's hair , "
6294	6302	6304	6305	Sir William	29	" But I have n't any hair , "
6536	6544	6545	6545	she	31	" Why do n't they come in ? "
6578	6583	6584	6584	she	33	" That 's Mama , "
6587	6593	6584	6584	she	33	" We must go in . "
6814	6818	6819	6819	she	31	" Not tonight , "
6834	6844	6845	6845	She	31	" I am sure it will bore Sir William ? "
6867	6876	6877	6877	he	304	" Not at all . Not at all , "
6882	6889	6890	6890	he	304	" Nothing would please me more , "
7039	7043	7044	7044	she	51	" The bazaar , "
